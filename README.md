Project for Grace Hopper Foundations course; a number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery.

Bugs still to work out: 
  -changes to DOM and guessCount decrementing aren't yet working for the special case when a user inputs a repeated guess.
  -submit with Return key: not yet added
